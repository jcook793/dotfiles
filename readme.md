# My Dotfiles

I took some inspiration from [this blog post](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789). I haven't gone as deep as that person yet, but it gives me some ideas if I want to get more fancy in the future.

## Installation

To setup a new Mac:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jcook793/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Then install Homebrew, do a quick `brew bundle` and get to work.
